**Exploit the features of TypeScript to develop and maintain captivating web applications with ease**

## What is this book about?
TypeScript is an open source and cross-platform typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or any host. It allows developers to use the future versions of JavaScript (ECMAScript 6 and 7) today. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn the key TypeScript language features and language runtime 
* Develop modular, scalable, maintainable, and adaptable web applications 
* Create object-oriented code that adheres to the solid principles 
* Save time using automation tools like Gulp and Karma 
* Develop robust applications with testing (Mocha, Chai and SinonJS) 
* Put your TypeScript skills in practice by developing a single-page web application framework from scratch 
* Use the JavaScript of tomorrow (ES6 and ES7) today with TypeScript
